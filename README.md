# macbook

This repository contains bootstrapping scripts so that I can install my personal development environment on a fresh installation of MacOS automatically and keep it synced to this repository

## Setup

Simply run in terminal:

```sh
/bin/zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fraguinha/macbook/master/setup.sh)"
```
